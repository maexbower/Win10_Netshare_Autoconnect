# Win10_Netshare_Autoconnect
PowerShell Script to autoconnect networkshares by users with no central credentialmanager
## Note:
This was the first target... After I started coding it turned out to be to much work. I now made a small BASH-Script that does nearly the same ;-)

## What to do:
Step 1: Download Netzwerklaufwer.cmd

Step 2: Make a copy of it in your AUTOSTART Folder and replace the parameters according to your setup.

Step 3: Run the Script by hand or just logout/-in again.
